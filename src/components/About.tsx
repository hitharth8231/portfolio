       I'm Hitharth Jain, a passionate Machine Learning and backend enthusiast currently pursuing my journey in tech through hands-on projects, real-world problem-solving, and continuous learning.

      With a strong foundation in Python, FastAPI, and modern data workflows, I enjoy building intelligent systems that create real impact — whether it's automating tasks, analyzing patterns, or deploying smart APIs. I'm deeply interested in data science, model optimization, and scalable architectures that blend simplicity with performance.

 What sets me apart is my commitment to clean, thoughtful code and my drive to learn deeply — not just for grades, but to solve problems that matter. I believe that great tech isn't just about tools, it's about mindset, community, and the courage to keep building.

 Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my machine learning skills, contributing to open projects, and preparing myself for industry-level challenges with curiosity and consistency.
